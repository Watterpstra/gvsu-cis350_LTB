# Introduction
* Our goal is to create a 2D Platformer game which has a Wild West theme with undead enemies. 
* We will be using the Unity game engine as our platform and iterating off of the standard 2D template that is provided. 
* There will be 5 levels that will each take the player 5 minutes to get through. 
* There shall be 10 different weapons to use, the weapons will have unlimited ammo with a time-based reload schedule. 
* The game shall work on Windows and Mac based devices.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will look to be using Unity as our development platform.
We will also be using the Unity Sprite editor to help make the various characters, enemies, and weapons.

# Method/Approach

We will go through and learn the Unity platform as much as possible, and proceed with development of the game threreafter. Functionality will be out first priority, while level design and sprites may be added on given we have time. Revision will happen once all functionality and basic sprites/themes have been implemented.

# Estimated Timeline

* Week of September 22nd to Week of October 6th - Learn Unity Platform
* Week of October 13th to Week of November 10th - Start backend development and complete
* Week of November 17th to Week of Novermber 24th - Start frontend development and complete
* Week of December 1st to Finals Week - Final tweaks/checks and commits

# Anticipated Problems

* We may have some scheduling issues for collaborating and meeting may be difficult.
* As we don't have a lot of experience utilizing Unity or C#, our ability to go about the process may bee less efficient.
* Need to hold all team members accountable based on best responsibilities.
